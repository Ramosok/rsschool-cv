In the current situation, it has become difficult for me to support my family. 
You either have to work very hard and not see how children grow up or be with them, 
but you can't afford everything. Then I decided to change something in my life, 
I need to find a job so that there is enough time and money for a family. 
So for the first time I decided to try myself in IT. 
Now I am studying at the full-time __Front-end Developer__ course at the *STEP Academy*,
and at the __RS-School__ courses.

4.At the moment, I am fluent in __HTML__, __CSS__, I am well versed in __SCSS__. I also have experience 
in __JS__ and in its libraries and frameworks such as __JQUERY__ and __React__.
I use __WS__ I know how to work with __GitHub__.
